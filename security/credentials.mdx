Portcullis follows a strict data minimization approach for credential management:

- Store only essential connection metadata
- Encrypt all stored credentials
- Use secure, ephemeral token-based authentication

## Key Security Principles

- No plain-text credential storage
- Automatic credential rotation
- Least-privilege access model
- Comprehensive audit logging
