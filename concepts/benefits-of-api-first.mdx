## The Traditional ETL Challenge

Traditional embedded ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) solutions often come with rigid architectures that limit developer flexibility. These monolithic approaches typically:

- Lock developers into predefined data transformation workflows
- Require extensive configuration for custom integrations
- Create significant overhead in adapting to changing data requirements

## Our API-First Approach

Our API-first embedded ETL solution fundamentally reimagines data integration by:

- Providing granular, composable API endpoints for each ETL stage
- Enabling real-time data transformation and routing
- Supporting complex, dynamic data pipelines through programmable interfaces

### Key Advantages

1. **Flexible Integration**
   Developers can seamlessly integrate ETL processes into their existing infrastructure, with minimal friction and maximum control.

2. **Programmable Workflows**
   Create custom data transformation logic using simple, RESTful API calls that adapt to your specific business needs.

3. **Performance-Optimized**
   Lightweight API design ensures minimal latency and high-throughput data processing.

## Getting Started

```javascript
// Simple export example
const options = {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {Authorization: 'Bearer <token>', 'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  body: '{"internal_warehouse":"3c90c3cc-0d44-4b50-8888-8dd25736052a","type":"<string>","organization":"3c90c3cc-0d44-4b50-8888-8dd25736052a"}'
};

fetch('http://app.runportcullis.co/exports', options)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(response => console.log(response))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

## Use Cases

- Microservice architectures
- Product analytics platforms
- Complex enterprise data integration scenarios
- Embedded logs exports
