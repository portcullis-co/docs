The Portcullis API requires an API key to identify and authorise calls. API keys are associated with a single Portcullis account. You can have more than key at any point in time.

Those keys are able to authenticate to Hyperline and perform actions on your account so itâ€™s important that you keep them safe in the same way that you would a password.

## Manage API keys

### Request an API key

Getting an **API key** is very simple and allow you to use Portcullis's API. If you don't have one, [schedule a demo](https://www.runportcullis.co/get-started) with our team.

## Using your credentials

API keys or access tokens must be provided with every API call, specified in the Authorization header after a Bearer prefix. All requests happen using HTTPS.

For example:

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <API key or access token>" https://app.runportcullis.co/exports
```

## Keeping your data safe

Your API keys should be treated as **highly sensitive information** - think of a token like a password. You should only give tokens to services you fully trust.

If leaked, tokens could be used maliciously - they can provide someone with access to all of your Portcullis data. If you suspect a token has been compromised, revoke it and replace it with a new one.
